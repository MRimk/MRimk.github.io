Just 3 weeks after Payerne 10k, I ran 10k road Swiss championship where I ran 31:41 (-38s!!!!) which was a very pleasant surprise after I went out and kept a race hard and honest. This was a treat of a course going in 2.5km loops without sharp turns and as flat as it could get (for Switzerland) elevation.
