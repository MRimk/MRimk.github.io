After 1 year had passed since my last proper 10km race for time (there are many races in Switzerland that are around 10km but not exactly), I stood at the start of the Payerne 10km race. It was 2 lap race around a relatively flat town of Payerne, with some sharp corners. At the start I got stuck behind some slower people and dropped a very fast first kilometer to catch my pace groups, but I did not end up having a group around me at any time of the race. I was catching people and trying to run with them but it would end up feeling too slow for me.

Either way, I managed to get a 1 minute 15 seconds personal best, and it was due time for it. My winter training with CTT has started paying off and it was a great time to do so.
